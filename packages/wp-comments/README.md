Comments package that adds integration for WordPress native comments.

## Install

```sh
npm i @frontity/wp-comments
```

## Usage

> In order to use this package, you will need to add a single line of configuration to your Wordpress installation:

```php
add_filter( 'rest_allow_anonymous_comments', '__return_true' );
```

You can add that directly in your `theme.php` file or use a [Code Snippets](https://wordpress.org/plugins/code-snippets/) plugin.

This package doesn't have any configuration, it should just be added in the `frontity.settings.js` to the `packages` array.

**`frontity.settings.js`**

```js
export default {
  packages: ["@frontity/wp-comments"],
};
```

More info about how to use this package can be found in the [Feature Discussion](https://community.frontity.org/t/wordpress-comments-package/1267).
